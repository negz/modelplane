# Two clusters, because the control-plane InferenceGateway (Traefik) and the
# workload ServingStack (Envoy) both install the Gateway API CRDs — on one
# cluster they race for the same cluster-scoped CRDs and the gateway wedges. So:
#   - a workload kind cluster (this script creates it), registered via
#     source: Existing, where the serving stack + model run;
#   - a control-plane cluster (crossplane project run manages it) with crossplane
#     + the config + the InferenceGateway.
