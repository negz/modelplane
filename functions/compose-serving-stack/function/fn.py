"""Install the serving stack on a remote cluster.

The stack is a list of components fixed at build time: the function
joins the XR's cloud and stack through the stacks package (see
function/stacks/__init__.py and design/serving-stack-generation.md) and
renders each entry - a Chart as a provider-helm Release, a Manifests as
provider-kubernetes Objects - all targeting the remote cluster via
ProviderConfigs built from the XR's secrets. The reconcile path holds no
decisions of its own: every version, values block, and membership
decision was resolved where a human reviewed a diff.

Ordering derives from the data too, in both directions. A component's
depends_on edges become Usage resources holding a dependency until its
dependents are gone, and they gate installs: a component is first
created only once every dependency reports Ready, so bring-up proceeds
in dependency waves instead of relying on Helm retrying into absent
prerequisites. The one hand-rendered piece is the gateway pair - the
GatewayClass and Gateway read spec.gateway, which stays per-cluster
API - plus the Usages sequencing their teardown ahead of the Envoy
Gateway release.
