"""The inference gateway pair, rendered from the XR's spec.

The GatewayClass and Gateway are the one part of the serving stack that
isn't build-time data: they read spec.gateway (className, listeners),
which is per-cluster configuration rather than a software version, so
they can't live in the stacks package. Everything around them is stack
data - the gateway namespace and the EnvoyProxy they reference come from
the stack's common components, and Envoy Gateway itself is a component.
fn.py renders these manifests with the same machinery it renders a
Manifests entry with.

# CEL readiness query for the Gateway Object. The Gateway's LoadBalancer
# address is assigned asynchronously by the controller after the Object is
# applied. With the default SuccessfulCreate policy the Object is Ready the
# instant it's created, so provider-kubernetes' poll-interval hook re-observes
# it only on the slow (10m) drift poll - leaving status.atProvider.manifest
# frozen at a pre-address snapshot, and the downstream scheduler with no gateway
# address, for up to ~10m. Gating readiness on status.addresses keeps the Object
# un-Ready until the address is observed, which drops the poll to ~30s so the
# address propagates promptly. `object` is the observed Gateway manifest; the
# has() guard keeps the query false (not erroring) before the controller first
# writes status.addresses.

    # A cluster given a hostname is fleet facing, and a fleet-facing gateway
    # serves mutually authenticated HTTPS or it serves nothing at all.
    #
    # Nothing at all, because there are only unsafe alternatives. The
    # gateway's Service is a public load balancer with a port per listener,
    # and the model-serving HTTPRoutes carry no sectionName, so they attach
    # to every listener there is: an HTTP listener alongside HTTPS, or left
    # in place while no CA is trusted, serves the engines to anything on the
    # internet with no certificate asked for. An HTTPS listener without its
    # ClientTrafficPolicy is worse, because it looks like it asks. Nothing in
    # the cluster wants either: the endpoint picker is an ext_proc the
    # gateway calls, not a client of it.
    #
    # So while no fleet gateway has published a CA, fn.serves_gateway
    # withholds the Gateway entirely (this only shapes its listeners). A
    # cluster with no hostname isn't fleet facing and keeps the plain HTTP
    # listener; it is never schedulable, so nothing routes to it.
