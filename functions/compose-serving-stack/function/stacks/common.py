"""Hand-written components on every cloud and every stack.

Modelplane's own half of the serving stack, where the Standard and
Dynamo stacks don't differ: the gateway path (Envoy Gateway, Envoy AI
Gateway and its CRDs, the Gateway API Inference Extension CRDs, the
gateway namespace and EnvoyProxy) and the DRA critical-pods quota.

The GatewayClass and Gateway are deliberately absent: they read
spec.gateway (className, listeners), which stays per-cluster API, so the
function renders them itself.

Versions here are Modelplane's pins: this file carries what no
generator resolves - the contract surface a ModelReplica composes
against, whose versions have nothing to do with the hardware (see
design/serving-stack-generation.md, "Component sources").
