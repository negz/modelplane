"""The cloud half of the stack for Vultr.

No generator covers Vultr, so Modelplane pins the cloud half by hand,
in the same shape a generator emits. Where a component also appears on
a generated cloud, this file states the same pin, so one review moves
both halves.

No node-feature-discovery here: VKE pre-installs a managed GPU
Operator add-on that runs NFD with tolerate-everything workers, and a
second instance would race it over the same label namespace. That
add-on also leaves the driver and toolkit to the node image (so the
DRA driver's default root holds). Its device plugin would advertise
nvidia.com/gpu beside the DRA ResourceSlices - two allocators with
independent ledgers over the same devices - so compose-vultr-cluster
labels Modelplane's GPU pools nvidia.com/gpu.deploy.device-plugin=false,
which the operator respects, leaving the DRA driver the sole allocator
on those nodes.
