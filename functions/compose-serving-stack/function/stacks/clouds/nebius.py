"""The cloud half of the stack for Nebius.

No generator covers Nebius, so Modelplane pins the whole cloud half by
hand, in the same shape a generator emits. Where a component also
appears on a generated cloud, this file states the same pin, so one
review moves both halves when a version changes - regenerate, then
mirror the shared pins here.
