"""Compose a ModelService's routing objects on one gateway's cluster.

A ModelRoute is one ModelService pinned to one InferenceGateway. The
ModelService composes a ModelRoute per gateway that serves it, carrying the
service's endpoint selectors, and this function renders the AIGatewayRoute
matching the service's model name, plus per endpoint the Backend, credential and
policy the gateway needs to reach it, onto that gateway's cluster.

The endpoint resolution and weight distribution are the same for every gateway,
so each ModelRoute redoes it from the same ModelEndpoints rather than the
ModelService pre-resolving and pinning a backend list. That keeps input
resolution in one place, and keeps the ModelRoute self-contained: given only the
gateway it's pinned to and the selectors it carries, it resolves the gateway's
cluster, the endpoints, their credentials and CAs, and renders.
