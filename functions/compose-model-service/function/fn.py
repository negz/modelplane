"""Compose a ModelRoute per InferenceGateway that serves a ModelService.

A ModelService is one model as a caller sees it. Which gateways serve it is the
gateway's choice, not the service's: an InferenceGateway's serviceSelector
matches the service's labels, and an absent selector matches every service. So
this function reads every InferenceGateway, works out which of them select this
service, and composes a ModelRoute per gateway, pinned to it.

The ModelRoute does the rest: it resolves the endpoints, their credentials and
CAs, and renders the routing objects onto its gateway's cluster. This function
composes onto no remote cluster and reads no ModelEndpoint. Its job is the
fan-out over gateways, and reporting how many of them carry the service.
